# Simple React todo app with MaterialUI and GraphQL

The purpose of this project is to showcase a simple example of React todo app with a couple twists.

- Material UI: This is most useful for the table with the fetched todo lists, it has pagination and sorting configurations as well.
- GraphQL backend: We're gonna use Apollo Client on the frontend

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

# WIP: This example is under active development

## To do

- Fix the ugly MUI Table: The docs example looks pretty damn complicated, pagination and sorting are to be added in the future)
- Add both forms
- Add mutation queries and make the Done button work
- Clean the code (it's trash i know, wip ;) )
